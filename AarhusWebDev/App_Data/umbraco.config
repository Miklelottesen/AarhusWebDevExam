        <body><![CDATA[<p><span>If you find yourself battling to decide between Umbraco vs WordPress – you’ve got to the right place. The post aims to provide you with all the ins and outs of both platforms for you to make the right choice, and therefore enhance your online presence and improve your life as an editor. One of the biggest questions in web design and development is what tool to choose. However, without a clear answer to the question “What am I trying to achieve?” you are going to have a hard time choosing the CMS to settle the web project on. When it comes to Umbraco vs WordPress – both systems have their merits and choosing the right one mostly depends on what the project’s requirements are. To give you a better idea of which will work better for your needs, here are some of their advantages and disadvantages. </span></p>
<h3><strong>What is Umbraco? </strong></h3>
<p>Umbraco is an open source CMS based on the Microsoft.NET platform that provides its users with all the great functionality they expect from a full-fledged CMS without the hefty licence fees. The platform has consistently proven to be one of the best CMS options due to its unlimited functionality and customizability.</p>
<h3><strong>What is WordPress? </strong></h3>
<p>WordPress is an open source blogging tool and a content management system based on PHP and MySQL. It is currently recognized as one of the most popular and talked-about software available, thanks to its vast template and plugin community.</p>
<h3><strong>Umbraco. The Pros and Cons. </strong></h3>
<p>Thousands of the world’s biggest brands (from Microsoft to Heinz) have chosen Umbraco due to the numerous benefits that it offers: It’s free. In other words, the budget issue is out of the window. It’s open source. Therefore, it’s constantly being improved by a devoted and collaborative community of developers and enthusiasts. It’s extremely flexible. Umbraco can be custom designed to meet your specific needs, no matter how large or small. However, where is light – there is also a shadow. Thus, Umbraco’s potential drawbacks that hold it back: Developer-friendly. Designed with developers in mind, the platform requires a little extra effort to get comfortable to how it works. Not plug-and-play solution. There are no plugins for expanding the core functionality. It can be done only through coding. Bugginess. There are still some annoyances, like templates that get duplicated in the database for no reason, sudden missing library references and some more serious ones. Performance. Umbraco is not too speedy.</p>
<h3><strong>WordPress. The Pros and Cons. </strong></h3>
<p>For those looking to get a website up and running without getting the hands dirty over codes and scripts should look no further than WordPress. The platform provides its followers with a large array of necessary tools to create everything from simple web pages to complex web applications.  Especially the platform prides itself on the following: It is extremely easy-to-use. Eye-catchy and professionally-looking websites can be created within a short coffee break, and exactly the simplicity has helped the platform gain its popularity among non-developers. It has unlimited functionality. There is a whole catalogue of ready to go themes and plugins aiming to help your site grow and scale as needed. It is well-trusted and supported. The platform’s active and vibrant community provides a welcoming place to help users cope with any issues. It is SEO-friendly. Being favoured by Google and other search engines makes the platform beneficial in terms of high positions in top rankings. There are, however, some drawbacks associated with WordPress. One of the largest concerns is the platform’s security. Due to the large number of plugins and templates with some of them being not properly designed, implemented, or updated, can leave your WordPress website vulnerable to hack attacks. It uses a lot of resources. Basic WordPress installation requires a theme and at least a few plugins to work effectively.This isn’t much of a problem but the more WordPress plugins you install the slower your website becomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Umbraco vs WordPress. Practical Considerations. </strong></h3>
<p>Let’s remind ourselves of the question we’ve stated at the beginning, “What am I trying to achieve?” and apply that now to each CMS. If you want a large corporate website that requires huge design freedom or pages with specific content requirements and makes use of dynamic content – then Umbraco should be high on your consideration list. WordPress, on the contrary, is a perfect fit if you want to get a site up and running quickly without large development or hosting overheads. It is more suitable for smaller websites that provide regular updates such as news or blogs and allow you.</p>]]></body>

        <body><![CDATA[<p><em>JavaScript is eating the world, with new tools and enhancements arriving at a breakneck pace. With Node.js, an open source runtime system invented in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, that reach has extended to the server side.</em></p>
<p><em>Node.js has become wildly popular, with coders everywhere using it to create APIs and build a new matrix of interoperability across the Internet. Joyent has been the chief sponsor of Node.js from the beginning. </em><em>In this week's New Tech Forum, Ben Wen, vice president of product marketing at Joyent, outlines six things you should know about the phenomenon shaking up backend development. -- Paul Venezia<br /></em></p>
<div id="drr-left"></div>
<p>Node.js is a runtime system for creating (mostly) server-side applications. It's best known as a popular means for JavaScript coders to build real-time Web APIs.</p>
<p>But Node.js is not a JavaScript framework; indeed, several authors have written excellent frameworks specifically for Node.js, including Express.js, Restify.js, andHapi.js. So what exactly <em>is</em> this phenomenon finding its way into Web applications,operating systems wrappers, microcontrollers, and robots?</p>
<p>At it's core, Node.js is a stripped-down, highly customizable server engine -- a proto-server, if you will -- because out of the box it doesn't do anything until you set it up. This proto-server processes in a loop, ready to accept and respond to requests. Any of those requests themselves may initiate other requests to some other part of the system, such as to read a file off of disk or to send a signal to spin a motor on a robot arm. That loop, known as the event loop, is the "runtime" part.</p>
<p>Node.js ships with workhorse connectors and libraries such as those relating to HTTP, SSL, compression, filesystem access, and raw TCP and UDP. JavaScript, already tuned for a Web browser's event loop environment for GUI and network events, is a great language for wiring up these connectors. You can snap connectors onto the event loop almost as easily as you can snap Lego parts together. Doing so lets you create a simple, dynamic Web server in just a few lines of JavaScript.</p>
<p>In short, Node.js is a runtime system that makes it easy to build a network or other event-driven application servers. Here are the six things you need to know about it:</p>
<p><strong>1. JSON has won</strong><br />JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a practical, compound, wildly popular data exchange format. JSON has enabled JavaScript developers to quickly construct APIs and foster interoperability at scale -- a key objective for Node.js coders. JSON's stark simplicity can be expressed in just five railroad parse diagrams, notably without the self-conscious preening of XML and its scheming friends (SOAP, XSD, WS-*, RELAX-NG, and their endless committee meetings).</p>
<p>JSON and JavaScript have reinforced each other's importance. Back in the early days of the Web, dynamic data in the browser had to be manipulated, filtered, and operated on by the only reasonably comprehensible non-plugin language available: JavaScript. Regardless of its original network-presentable format, data needed to be marshalled into a JavaScript object. The dependence on JSON for general purpose data description gave rise to document-oriented NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB. It's all JSON all the time today.</p>
<p><strong>2. JavaScript is everywhere</strong><br />JavaScript is a quirky, object-oriented, C-like language. It's the only choice for developing applications in the browser, with a new framework introduced every week to woo developers. And with Node.js, JavaScript has spilled over to the server. Competing implementation teams have driven JavaScript interpreters forward, so that Google's V8 engine is respectably fast -- fast enough to reside at the core of Node.js.</p>
<p>JavaScript also has the internal capability to handle the event loop mechanism in a straightforward way. Other languages have this capability, which are used by their own evented systems. Python has Twisted and Ruby has EventMachine. But because of history, both of those event-loop systems come freighted with relatively easy ways to make a particular kind of performance mistake, while JavaScript remains relatively free of this peril.</p>
<p>JavaScript also runs across many OS environments, having historically had to support them in the browser. This, along with the libuv library to help abstract away some of the operating system differences, means that Node.js has a broad footprint.</p>
<p>But the biggest force for JavaScript's migration to the server side is human. Programmers have to do less mental context-switching between a Web browser and the server. There are even efforts to unify the environments between client and the server so that code can run equally well in either location, further simplifying the model and leading to increased productivity.</p>]]></body>

As it turned out, a calculator requires very little beside numbers and mathematical operators. We skipped beta, and launched straight on Google Play. We have 5 downloads so far - coincidentally, that's also the size of our development team, so we take that as a good omen!

All basic math operators implemented and tested. Now, to implement numbers.

Production started. We had to hire a team of scientists, as nobody on the dev team had any clue as to how adding and subtracting could possibly be implemented in code - after all, this hasn't been done before ever, so we're exploring new territory.]]></devLog>

Some argue that this is not noob-friendly, having to start the game all over again EVERY time you hit a ghost, so we're considering to add a function that gives the player 3 tries before game over; upon ghost contact, the level will simply reset, allowing the player to try again.

-------------------------------------
Paul had this idea that it could be fun to add a gameplay mechanic that would allow the player to break away from the constant flow of being chased, into a temporary state in which the player gets to chase the ghosts. He even coded a version of the game where he added FRUITS at certain places in the maze, and when you eat one of those fruits, the ghosts start flashing and go from chasing after you to fleeing from you, then you can chase them and eat them, and they'll die. He has a lot of creative idea, but boy does he smoke a lot of granola! I mean, seriously, a cheese eating fruit? I'm worried if the public will be able to accept this...

-------------------------------------
We ended up implementing Paul's fruit idea (democratic vote, NOT my idea). The truth is, nobody could find any better solution to add the required gameplay variations. And the results from the user tests indicate that people find the gameplay to be too linear - guess this is a necessary tradeoff.

BUT, we're not gonna accept his idea unconditionally - the fact is, that with Paul's version, you can clear the level of ghosts in no time, and then the rest will just be eating the remaining dots with no challenge whatsoever. So I've insisted that we tweak it, so the ghosts don't die, but simply gets "deactivated" for a while, then they'll return to the middle where they came from and become active after a set amount of time.]]></devLog>
